    title: "CUTE WORKOUT ‘FIT FOR GYM & BEYOND!",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - January 26",
    shortDescription: "",
    description: `There are days when I find it impossible to feel motivated to workout, especially during cold winter days. However, there are two things I will do to push myself; one, remind myself how good I’ll feel both physically and mentally post workout and two, throw on a cute exercise ‘fit! 

    If you are in need of an extra push too, and looking for a cute outfit idea to spark some much-need motivation, take this look here as inpo. The matching set I’m wearing is by my SJ for Bandier collection, called the Rowana (also available in different prints and shades!). It’s simply stunning and perfect for movement. The material is insanely breathable and luxe, I can guarantee you’ll want to hit that workout class asap! It pairs beautifully with sneakers or birkenstock slides. Finish this look with a puffer or coat to keep you warm!

    title: "WHAT TO WEAR TO A HOLIDAY PARTY!",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA December 23",
    shortDescription:
      "Major outfit inspo for your next holiday soirée. Take a look!",
    description: `Hi everyone! I hope you’re all well and enjoying the holidays. Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year for many reasons. From spending quality time with my loved ones, to the celebratory atmosphere, to the music, to the food, and to the joy that emanates from people. The spirit of the holiday season truly is magical, and I feel so blessed to have some of the most beautiful memories during this time of the year. 

    One thing we can all agree on is the stress of trying to figure out what to wear to all the holiday festivities. But not to worry, if you’re in need of some inspo I’ve got you covered with the most perfect Christmas ‘fit. This day only comes once a year, so I like to go all out from head to toe. 
    
    Going for xmas color plaids is an excellent choice for the festive day (plus it brings a cozy element to your look). Team it with a skirt and a sparkly heel to dress it up. Then you’re going to accessories with statement earrings to really make this look stand out – don’t forget to finish the look with a fun bag to bring this ‘fit together. There you have it, comfy, chic, and festive – this ensemble was made for Christmas!
    
    Happy holidays everyone, thank you so much for choosing to be here. Sending you all a big hug and well wishes for the new year! `,

    locationDate: "MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - December 12",
    shortDescription:
      "A simple but chic outfit perfect to wander your city in. Take a look!",
    description: `I’ve always loved the pairing of a knit & shorts combo. It’s casual yet refreshing, and one of those outfits that just feels easy. 

      To put this ensemble together begin with your bottoms first – I went with some semi-loose fitting Levi’s shorts, and styled them with an oversized turtleneck to keep cozy and warm. For the shoes, I went with loafers, I love how they compliment and amp up the chic factor of this ‘fit. This is the perfect street style look to wander your city in. `,

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - November 04",
    shortDescription:
      "Take a look at how I styled this pajama set! Perfect for a casual/chic outing!",
    description: `When getting dress, one thing about me is that I will always try to prioritize comfort over anything else. Especially when it’s a full day of running errands – comfort must take precedence. On such days, an easy solution is to throw on a matching set (pajama sets including). They’re just so easy to dress up or down and make for the perfect outfit formula to create a cozy-chic ensemble. 

    If you’re worried about not looking polished enough, all you have to do incorporate elevated pieces and accessorize. For example, here I styled this set with an oversized blazer, this instantly turned this matching set up a notch while still providing enough comfort. Go the extra mile and add cute jewelry to the mix, and finish the look with sneakers & a  bag. You’re ready to tackle the day ahead in style and comfort. `,

      "Take look at my fall go-to beauty products that help keep my skin looking glowy!",
    description: `Cold weather is upon us, which means it’s time to switch up our summer beauty products to colder weather essentials! Every season we prepare for fall by swapping out our summer ‘fits to warm cozy fall clothing. But I find it imperative to also switch up some of my beauty products and skincare routines. During the months of summer we need extra SPF, spray mists to keep our skin fresh etc. Those products work well into the new season, however I like to also consider products that will specifically help keep my skin moist and glowy when exposed to dry / cold air. 

    There are several beauty formulas I like to use to keep my skin looking dewy in the colder months. From serums, to face masks, hair products, and tools. I’ve rounded up some of my go-to beauty essentials for fall. Take a look! 
    
    Comment below any beauty products you swear by and think I should try.`,

      "The perfect casual chic outfit for your next city adventure. Check it out!",
    description: `I’m through and through a denim girl. My ideal go-to outfit always involves a pair of jeans, therefore I’m always looking for ways to breathe new life into my denim looks. For a look that’s both polished and comfortable go for a sweatshirt & jeans combination – to instantly elevate your look opt for a low mule. Adding a pair of statement hoop earrings, sleek sunnies and a cute bag to the mix will give your ensemble that extra umph. Wear this perfect look to do errands around the city or to meet friends for an al fresco lunch.`,

    shortDescription:
      "Looking for ways to style a mini dress? Check out this look that works for almost every occasion.",
    description: `I am a sucker for mini dresses – they’re the ultimate item for almost any occasion. What makes them so special is that they’re flirty, fun and seriously so convenient as they’re an outfit in and of themselves. All you have to worry about is what shoes & accessories you’re wearing.

    The one I’m wearing here is by IRO Paris – I absolutely love the print and how flattering is the silhouette? Wanted to dress it down a bit so styled it with slides, minimal accessories and a high pony – a little glam with a touch of comfort. Switch things up after dark with a barely-there chic sandals or mules. Bottom line, you can’t go wrong dressing a mini up or down.
    
    If you’re on the hunt for the perfect mini, I’ve done the hard work for you and scoured the internet with several options I’m sure you’ll love. Take a look at the link below.`,

    locationDate: "PALM SPRINGS, CA - April 29",
    shortDescription:
      "If you missed Coachella but are still making your way to the desert, take a look at this fit I put together that's sure to suit your desert getaway.",
    description: `If you’re thinking of going on  a desert getaway and in need of an outfit idea, I’ve got one thats suitable. Wore this little number during Coachella weekend and it was a total vibe.

    An oversized vest is perfect to wear in the desert, as it’s airy enough to keep you from over heating while still offering that cool edge. Paired it with a mini skirt, boots and finished it off with a buckled belt. Went with an earthy / neutral palette as these tones always look amazing against a desert backdrop. Wear this one to explore all the cute vintage shops in Joshua tree or to dine al fresco in palm springs.`,

An easy item that comes to mind is a flowy maxi dress!

To get you in a summer state of mind, let this outfit here serve as inspo.

    shortDescription:
      "Spring time is upon us, which means it’s time to start updating your wardrobe with pops of color. Check out how I styled a pop of yellow three ways!",
    description: `With spring around the corner, I have bright pops of color on my mind. When we created the SJ for Bandier collections, we made sure to incorporate fun colors to our pieces. One fave is our goldenrod shade, a fun mustard/yellow hue that stands out from the rest. We all loved it so much we incorporated this shade to several of our pieces. Ahead, I styled three eye-catching ‘fits in the goldenrod shade using pieces from the SJ for Bandier collection. Check them out! If you’re intimidated by bold colors, I suggest adding just a small dose of color to your outfit. Here, I paired the Flint wide leg pant, with the Juniper Zip up hoodie and styled it with Willow tank for the perfect amount of color to brighten up this look. Perfect to WFH in or to take a stroll to your local coffee shop. Alternatively, you can swap the zip-up for a denim jacket and throw on slides for an elevated take.
    Comment below which look is your fave!`,

    locationDate: "MIAMI, FL - March 11",
    shortDescription:
      "If you're looking for an outfit refresh, give this subtle tie-dye look a try. Take a look!",
    description: `If you’ve been wondering if tie dye is still in, the answer is – it never left! These past two years we’ve been seeing tie dye everywhere. From dresses, to tanks, to shorts, to the beloved sweater matching set, you name it. I for one absolutely love the trend for its vibrant colors and fun artsy feel – it’s a total vibe. I know not everyone is a fan, but hopefully I can change your mind with this look. 😉 

    For those who are having a hard time styling this trend, go for a subtle approach and only wear one tie dye item with the rest of your ensemble. For this look, I styled my tie dye tank by Ellie Mae (linked below) with an oversized button down, black skirt and strappy sandals. Wearing neutral tones with tie dye is a great way to break up all the noise tie dye prints offer. I added some jewelry for a pop of polish. `,

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - March 02",
    shortDescription:
      "Looking for some inspo on how to wear your favorite joggers. Check out how I styled this cozy chocolate brown jogger set!",
    description: `Long gone are the days where joggers are only worn from the comfort of your own home. They’ve become an extremely versatile piece of clothing and I’m really loving all the ways you can style them. You can incorporate into your workwear, casual days or even to dressy functions depending on how you style them. 

    The ones I’m wearing here are a part of my SJ for Bandier drop 4 collection and guess what we added a zip-up hoodie to match (linked above). I’m a sucker for street-style, so I went ahead and styled this set with a tee, scrunchie socks, and new balance sneakers for a day of wandering the city. For a dressier approach, swap the sneaks & socks for some strappy heels and throw on a blazer! `,

    title: "HOW TO STYLE COMBAT BOOTS!",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - February 21",
    shortDescription: "Check out this easy way to style combat boots!",
    description: `Combat boots – a classic staple that has been around for years and never goes out of style. To be honest when I got my first pair, I found them intimidating to style but after experimenting with several items in my closet I found that they pair amazingly well with an array of outfits. I either like to go for something soft and feminine like a flowy maxi dress or a mini, or I like to pair them with a structured jacket. When it comes to pairing them with pants I prefer a trouser or a cropped loose jean. So, if you’re debating if you should purchase a pair, I say go for it. Also do note that they work all year round so they’re a great investment. 😉

    The ones I’m wearing here are by proenza, I really love the white trim on these as it gives the boot a cool contrast. I styled them with biker shorts and threw on an oversized flannel for a grunge take. To soften up the look, I accessorized with gold statement earrings and a sleek updo. 
    
    Are you a fan of combat boots? Comment below! `,

      "Take a look at this sporty/chic look for when you're on the go. So effortless & easy!",
    description: `There’s something so effortless about pairing shorts with an oversized sweatshirt. I often find myself gravitating towards this off-duty look when I don’t want to overthink about what to wear. Isn’t it the best feeling when an outfit comes together with no fuss and just feels effortless? That’s how I feel about this look seen here.

    If the weather is chilly where you currently find yourself, maybe try a pair of loose denim or even some sleek black leggings. The result is still sporty chic that’s equal parts cool and comfortable. Otherwise, keep the shorts and tie it all together with socks, everyone’s fave dad sneak – New Balance, a crossbody bag and some dainty jewelry.  
    
    What’s your no-fuss go-to look? Comment below!`,

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA June 11",
    shortDescription:
      "When it comes to my everyday beauty routine, I have a list of essential products that I like to use daily. Check them out!",
    description: `My make-up/beauty routine is pretty much the same everyday. I definitely love to experiment with new looks from time to time but for everyday beauty wear, I like to stick with an easy, breezy light coverage look that’s easy to pull and that works well year round. I’m such a sucker for the warmer seasons – probably because we all get that natural glow from the heat going. Everything that I use daily are items to help achieve a natural sun-kissed vibe, and using the right products that target specifically what I want from dewy cheeks to beachy soft hair to silky glowy skin help me maintain this look year round. This is my ultimate go-to look and guess what it’s super low maintenance and easy to achieve. 

    Below I’m sharing some of my everyday go-to beauty essentials from favorite make-up products to hair products to nail polish to skin products to even favorite perfumes! Keep scrolling through! `,

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - December 03",
    shortDescription:
      "Excitement doesn't begin to describe how I feel about this launch!! Biggest collaboration to date and I can't wait for you guys to see it because I'm sooo proud of it! Come take a look at my little story about this amazing partnership! AHHHH!!!",
    description: `O M G !!!

 

    Can’t even really type this of how excited I am of this launch with you guys!!! AHHHHH!! (insert screaming here!!!)
    
     
    
    A little back story. When I was growing up, maybe about when I was 4-7yrs old, my mom would always make me the cutest bows, headbands, and any little hair accessory that would make me stand out from the rest of the girls in school. We didn’t have a lot of money so she would always make me these accessories because my parents couldn’t really afford to buy me the latest shoes or backpacks. This sweet memory of my childhood with my mom really is so special and nostalgic to me, that’s why this particular collaboration with one of my favorite brands growing up, SCUNCI, is everything to me. Not only does it bring back that beautiful nostalgic feeling and memory but I’m able to combine my love for hair and style into really affordable accessories that you can wear! It really cant’t get any better than that!
    
    When Scunci approached me with the idea of doing a collection together, I didn’t hesitate to say YES! It was like a dream to be not only be able to do something so fun and exciting with a brand I’ve been a big fan of but also be able to relive those childhood memories and bring it to the masses! The icing on the cake? Being sold exclusively a Target….. you guys, TARGET! Ah!!!!
    
     
    
    You can now shop my 40 piece collection at any Target store and online in the hair accessory aisle. There’s literally something for everyone- from cute scrunchies (my fave!) to pretty headband bandanas that you can wear multiple ways to sparkly barrettes,to bobby pins, to clips,  to turban headbands… I mean, there’s so much stuff to choose from! Hair accessories are definitely back and my collection with Scunci is something I’m soooo proud to share with you guys! Everything is under $10! The pieces are perfect for everyday, morning to night, from the gym to a special fancy event at night!
    
    I hope you guys love the pieces, as much as I do, would mean the world to me if you went to Target and checked them out! Can’t wait to see how you guys style them… make sure when you post on instagram to use the hashtag #SincerelyScuci. Stay tuned as I’ll be sharing more photos of how I wear the pieces!`,

    title: "I NEVER EXPIRE | SK-II CAMPAIGN",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - May 03",
    shortDescription:
      "Very passionate about this topic about society and ageism. I'm sharing my personal pressures and why I believe in SK-II's #INeverExpire initiative. Would love to hear your personal experiences!",
    description: `I’m the youngest of four and growing up with older siblings was always fun, but it also came with the pressure to follow in their footsteps. I’ve always struggled with accomplishing the so to speak ‘societal norms’ by a certain age. Most of my siblings had the house, the family, the career path all set by the time they were 30. Naturally, I felt like I had to fulfill these milestones as well. Sometimes, I was teased about not being married and having kids by the time I hit the big 3-0, and it made me have my own hang-ups about life. It made me question myself and decisions; often I found myself asking questions like, “Am I good enough to accomplish these goals?” or “am I falling behind compared to my siblings and peers?” I felt like I was being boxed into this “you have to be this certain age” to consider myself “successful” or even “accomplished.” I feel that society puts an age-related social stigma on women about accomplishing certain things by a certain age. This is an unrealistic approach to life, and I want to challenge this belief system. There is no such thing as an expiration date or age for living out our lives and dreams.

    For me, it’s always been crucial to set goals for myself. Setting these goals didn’t mean putting an age limit to when they needed to be achieved. Although, I did feel the pressure from family, friends and society, I knew I never wanted to follow anyone’s footsteps but my own. I wanted to do things on my own terms. My goals weren’t geared towards having kids before I reached 30, or taking up a common career path or even being a home owner before I ended my twenties. I wanted to live against the grain, and defeat these old-fashion notions because we deserve to be happy at every age. My goals were not to check any of these pressures off my checklist by 25, 30 or 35, but instead it was about following my heart and doing them when they felt like the time was right for me. Now, at 32, two years after society’s “aged” deadline, I’m not married yet (we are engaged though!), we don’t have kids, and we have yet to find our dream home. But, more than ever, I feel the most proud to be this age. Most importantly, I’m happy and I feel confident that everything comes in due time when it’s meant to be. 
   
    After choosing to create my own path in life, I’ve been supported and even praised by friends and family on following my heart. It feels damn good to do what I want, when I want!
   
    With all the age-related shame that society imposes on women, I’m very happy brands like SK-II have decided to challenge these expectations. They’ve launched a powerful, global campaign called #INeverExpire in hopes of inspiring women to take a stand and live life on their own terms, regardless of age. It’s a beautiful initiative that will resonate with many of us who have experienced age-related pressures. SK-II discusses all these issues in their moving film titled, ‘The Expiry Date‘ which not only leaves you feeling empowered, but also moved and inspired to break the rules.
   
    Let’s make a promise to ourselves to embrace where we are in our lives no matter how old we are. Remember, there’s no expiration date on your dreams, you just have to believe in yourself and go for it! The definition of happiness is not measured through your age but by timeless self-love. Live your own life, dance to the beat of your own drum because that’s living life to the fullest. Go on a journey where numbers and expiration dates don’t exist. Together, we stand tall and proud to praise what we have accomplished, not what we haven’t.
   
    Follow your own beautiful path because it’s the one no one has walked but you. Your life and path are your own, it’s up to you to create your destiny. I’m living mine with no age attached because #INeverExpire.
   
    I enjoyed watching actress Chloe Bennet’s response to the video, you can see it on Vanity Fair, here. I want to hear your thoughts and experiences on this issue, what age pressures have YOU faced from society? When did you decide to live your life on your terms? If so, what made you do it and why?
   
    
   
   Thank you SK-II for creating this compelling global awareness and sponsoring this post.`,

    title: "MY SK-II #ONEBOTTLEAWAYFROM JOURNEY",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES. CA - April 27",
    shortDescription:
      "So excited I finished the #OneBottleAwayFrom journey with SK-II! My skin hasn't looked or felt this good in so long...read why I took on this journey!",
    description: `With a constant workload of projects and non-stop traveling, my skin always takes the first hit. I try to take care of my skin as much as possible, but dedicating time to a consistent beauty regimen is not always easy with all the craziness. In hopes of a skin transformation after months of a stressful and dysfunctional routine, I started using SK-II Facial Treatment Essence.

    From day to day, I don’t wear too much makeup, but with my work, I have to constantly load it up for photoshoots. I’ve always been a bit insecure about my skin, particularly about having acne, an oily T-zone (so annoying!), pores around my nose, and not having smooth texture. Discovering SK-II Facial Treatment Essence (which has been dubbed “miracle water”) has been really life-changing for me! Suddenly my skin looks fresh, glowy and youthful and I feel so much more confident to wear less makeup and let my skin breathe. The reason this product is so effective is PITERAÔ – a bio-ingredient rich in vitamins, minerals and other micro-nutrients designed to soften and smooth skin, even skin tone, enhance your natural radiance and minimize pores and wrinkles! How could I not wanna use this on my face? So good!
    
    Once I learned more about this “miracle water” (and all its benefits), I decided to embark on my #OneBottleAwayFrom journey – hoping to transform my skin to be radiant, smooth, firm and even, so I can feel confident going make-up free! I decided I was #OneBottleAwayFrom getting that flawless skin before my big trip to Mexico. My new regimen also helped me stay focused and committed to achieving beautiful healthy skin for an exciting and huge project (can’t wait to share more later!). I knew we would be shooting on the beach with minimal makeup and I wanted to make sure my skin was perfect. Luckily, after only a few weeks of using this essence, I started seeing a dramatic transformation in my skin, especially the texture – which made me so happy! My skin looked pretty flawless for the trip, which was the goal, but seeing the transformation has inspired me to keep this essence as a permanent part of my routine! I’ve seen a difference in all the areas I always felt insecure about: it minimized the pores around my nose, wrinkles around my eyes, evened out my skin tone and my skin definitely looks more radiant!
    
    The application also couldn’t have been easier – just apply a splash every morning and night before moisturizers or serums. I sprinkle several drops into my palm, rub my hands together and then tap onto my face, neck and chest.
    
    Allowing my skin to get proper treatment and rebuild itself was the best thing I’ve done for myself in a while and I couldn’t be more excited to show off my skin transformation! Feeling happy and confident when I look at myself in the mirror with no make-up on is the most liberating and powerful feeling I’ve felt in a while. The #OneBottleAwayFrom journey not only transformed my skin but it transformed my mind and confidence.
    
    Thank you SK-II for sponsoring this post.`,

    shortDescription:
      "A quick getaway to my favorite place, Tulum + Quintana Roo, Mexico to experience a dreamy launch of Aerin's new perfume, the Hibiscus Palm. Come take a look!",
    description: `Last month I was able to go back to my favorite place and help celebrate the launch of AERIN’s new fragrance, Hibiscus Palm, that will get you daydreaming of an exotic vacation and packing your bags to a fun getaway filled with sunshine, sand and palm trees! Totally my kind of getaway! The team put together a beautiful itinerary that included early morning yoga sessions, water activities (kayaking & paddle boarding), massages, a trip to the cenotes and the most gorgeous dinners you’d seen- you almost felt as if you were attending a wedding on the beach with how gorgeous and detail oriented the dinners were.

    We got to spend time with Aerin herself, who is an absolute joy to be around and is so sweet and humble! She walked us through her inspiration for this fragrance and told us it was a mix of all her favorite things- summer, sunshine, beach, Mexico and flowers. Sounds like all of my favorite things too! There wasn’t a better way to experience this gorgeous fragrance than getting away to Tulum to help experience the coconut, white florals, vanilla and the hibiscus palm thats blended in the fragrance- it really helps take you to a tropical, exotic island/beach that you don’t ever want to leave.

    locationDate: "February 20",
    shortDescription:
      "One of my favorite places to go for a quick getaway is Palm Springs! Sharing where to stay and what to do in this fun little town!",
    description: `One of my favorite places to visit in California is Palm springs! It’s only a 3 hour drive from LA, the weather is perfect right now and there are so many fun and relaxing things to do. Kevin and I celebrated our 6th anniversary there a couple of weeks ago and it was nothing short of perfect! 

    Below, I’m going to share some of my favorite hotels to stay at, restaurants and some fun things to do while you’re there! So keep scrolling! 
    SANDS HOTEL & SPA – This trip we decided to stay at the Sands Hotel and we are so glad we did because it was a dream! Everywhere you looked was so cute and photogenic! This hotel had major Miami vibes with all the lush greenery and pink interior. The pool area was gorgeous and offered cute pink daybeds to relax in! The room we stayed in was so nice and spacious, it came with a little patio & fountain – so cute! I swear this place was instagram heaven! Also, the hospitality was so awesome! FYI, this hotel is located in Indiana Wells, about 25 min out of Palm Springs.

THE COLONY PALMS HOTEL – This hotel is so cute! It’s located centrally in the heart of Palm Springs, which I love because you can literally walk to all the cute shops and restaurants! It’s also newly renovated, so everything feels so clean and new. The restaurant/bar area is elevated and chic. The crowd feels a little Hollywood but the drinks are fantastic! I’ve ordered classic margaritas several times and they are always on point!

KORAKIA PENSIONE HOTEL – I’ve stayed at this hotel several times and it’s so charming and peaceful! You’ll forget whether you’re in California or the Mediterranean. This place offers a pool, many outdoor spaces that include fire pits, fountains and stone paths – so pretty and unexpected. The food is also yummy here! I highly recommend you book a room here if you like boutique style hotels. My only unfortunate complaint is that the hot water runs out quick! 

WORKSHOP KITCHEN + BAR – A must every time I’m in Palm Springs! My favorite items on the menu are the fries, truffle burger and wood fire pizza! So delicious! 

THE PINK CABANA – This restaurant is so beautiful! From the tile floors, to the decor and the branding – so stunning and instagramable! Ate here for brunch and ordered the green chile chicken tacos, the milk bread french toast and had a few juices. All so yummy! 

BIRBA – Love the ambiance this place has to offer! The Pappardelle Al Ragu and the Birba Pizza were to die for. For dessert I had the butterscotch pudding! Buenicimo! `,

      "Self-care is so essential to your well being. Check out 6 simple ways I like to de-stress.",
    description: `We all experience stress at some point in our lives. Whether it’s minor challenges to major crises, stress unfortunately is just a normal part of life. Although stress is a natural reaction, it’s still a negative force that takes a serious toll on both your professional life and mental health.

    In this day and age where everything is moving fast and we are always wanting to be in the know and keep up with things, there’s a pressure to always be on but there is nothing wrong with turning everything off. It’s important for us to give ourselves time to relax and recharge. So if you’re feeling stressed and anxious, know that you’re not alone and that there are techniques out there that can help you feel better. 
    
    Carving out time to focus on your wellbeing is so important! Below I’m sharing tips on what I like to do to relax and de-stress when I’m feeling overwhelmed and ps- I’m stressed pretty often so hope these tips help! 
    
    GET MOVING
    
    I know, I know it’s the last thing you want to do when you’ve had a long day. But even taking 10 minutes out of your day to exercise can make a huge difference. YouTube has a ton of 5-10 min fitness videos you can workout to, some super easy and efficient. I also like to go on a quick run or even a walk, you don’t have to do a strenuous workout to get those endorphins flowing. 
    
    WRITE IN A JOURNAL
    
    This is a great way to reflect and plan. Write down all of those negative thoughts and also what brings you joy. Ask yourself what you could be doing more of that will help smooth you. There is so much power in writing, let that little journal be a place where you can leave your stresses and worries behind even just for a moment. I like to write first thing in the morning, especially what I’m grateful for. I have noticed that when I do that, I feel more at ease starting my day! 
    
    MEDITATE 
    
    Meditation is a great way to calm the mind. If you’re new to meditation (as I am) I recommend you download a meditation app. I use the app Breeth – this app is great for beginners because it offers guided meditations. You have the option to choose how long you want to meditate, and a soothing voice will guide you through what you’re supposed to do. 
    
    TAKE AN AROMATHERAPY BATH
    
    Nothing feels more relaxing than soaking in a warm bath to wind down after a long and exhausting day. I like to add a few drops of lavender essential oil as it offers a soothing effect and promotes a better night’s sleep. 
    
    GET ARTSY
    
    Do something creative that you enjoy. This is probably my favorite thing to do out of this list just because I love being creative! For me, I find painting to be so therapeutic, but any form of art can take your mind off of whatever is stressing you. 
    
    READ A BOOK 
    
    I like to set aside time in my day to read. Immersing yourself in a story is a good way to distract yourself from your daily stressors but if you’re not into books, try a cool magazine and enjoy cool imagery to help you get your mind off what you’re stressing about! 
    
    I hope these tips are helpful – if one method doesn’t work try another. Learning to relax takes time, so be patient with yourself and in no time you will figure out what works best for you. 😉 `,

      "I want to use this space to boost the creative voices of Black Artists.",
    description: `My heart has been heavy recently, but the unity, love, and solidarity we all have seen on a global level, gives me hope. Hope for change, hope for equality and hope for a better tomorrow. It’s a beautiful reminder that collectively, we can reshape the future.

    I’ve been using my time to focus on donating to organization’s that are working to create real change. I am doing the work to sign petitions, vote, and educate myself on Black History, oppression, violence, and systemic racism. As a Mexican woman of color, I am anti-racist. I stand with love, compassion, and awareness with and for the Black community. My heart is strong and prepared to resist and fight for racial justice. I will do everything in my power to support and push to create radical change.
    
    It’s imperative for myself and the SJ team to continue to show our solidarity and help amplify Black voices and people of color in our community. We wanted to create a list and highlight some beautiful Black influencers, artists, beauty and fashion brands I’ve followed over the years and some recent accounts we’ve come across! Pictured and numbered below are just a few amazing and inspiring Black creatives that have touched my life and inspired me.
    
    Please add to this space by sharing other Black artists of all mediums.
    
    Here’s to Love, Light, and powerful change NOW!`,

It’s one of those events that’s so cool to experience and watch professional surfers do their thing while they ride some of the biggest waves- they can go as high as 15ft!!! So crazy!!

    We hung out in Waikiki and celebrated the launch of Billabong’s New Wave collection which is pretty rad, it was a total 80’s revival look!! YES please!! The bubble gum color palette, 80’s vintage graphics and cool pieces made the collection so coveted! I loved wearing the corduroy babyblue shorts with the yellow bikini top and fanny pack.
    
    I had never been to Waikiki before but spending a couple days there before driving down to Oahu had to be my favorite. With so much to see and do and shop, it felt like there was always something new!`,

    shortDescription:
      "A beautiful day visit to the Children's Hospital with n:PHILANTHROPY. It was emotional but made me feel proud to be able to contribute to kids in need. Take a look at my experience!",
    description: `Last week, I had the absolute honor and pleasure of visiting the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), which is a nonprofit institution that provides pediatric health care to children, with one of my favorite brands at the moment, n:PHILANTHROPY. What I love about n:PHILANTHROPY is the fact that they care to give back to children and animals in need. Their brand fully supports pediatric cancer research, the cancer nursing program and Beads of Courage program by giving 10% of their net proceeds. This unique part of their brand is truly heartwarming and makes me so proud to be apart of this with them.

    I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to work with many great brands throughout my blogging years but n:PHILANTHROPY really stands out for me and makes a difference in fashion. I really appreciate that n:PHILANTHROPY is supporting and helping to contribute to these programs while trying to help bring light and hope to families during some of the most trying times they will face with their children. Being a part of this, helped me personally to really spend more time giving back to kids, people, animals in need and special cancer research programs. It’s a cause that I want to be more involved in and help make a difference in these kids’ lives.
    
    I was able to visit the Children’s Hospital for the day last week with the n:PHILANTHROPY team and visit a couple of the kids that have been diagnosed with cancer and have gone through chemo. I got to spend time with them and helped donate toys to them to play with. I also learned more about the Beads of Courage program which I think is a beautiful program to have the kids and families be apart of. The program is designed to honor and recognize the challenging journey kids take while receiving care for cancer or blood conditions. Each bead represents a treatment the kid has gone through and its a way to help turn a challenging fight into a way to honor and be proud of the milestone they’ve overcome. When I heard about each families story and how the Beads of Courage program have really made a positive impact in their lives during their whole journey, I got really emotional because you can see the pain each family and kids have gone through and these beads have been a reminder to them of hope and courage.
    
    I’m happy to be stepping away a little from fashion and into something more meaningful and bigger. I have nine nieces and nephews and they mean the world to me, so being a part of this and giving back to kids in need hits home for me.
    
    So, I’m happy I can contribute but also have you guys be a part of it too! n:PHILANTHROPY will be donating 20% of net proceeds from the Sincerely Jules favorite n:PHILANTHROPY items section on their website. I selected several of my favorite items and 20% of the proceeds for items sold from my favorite collection will go to CHLA and the cancer research program. This makes me so proud and excited!
    
     
    
    THANK YOU TO CHLA and n:PHILANTHROPY for allowing me to be a part of this!`,

      "What to wear to the beach to have a little R&R! Sara and I are celebrating summer with beach chic looks!",
    description: `While were were in the Hamptons, Sara and I decided to spend the day at the beach and just do a little R&R. It was a bit crowded but the weather was perfect enough to not even pay any attention.

    If you’re like me, I always try to wear something to the beach that serves two purposes: laying out & afterwards grabbing lunch. You want to be able catch some sun but at the same wrap yourself up in something cute so that you can up and go rather quickly to grab a bite afterwards.
    
    Here are a few tips on showing you how to be beach chic ready:
    
    Throw on a denim jacket instead of a coverup
    wear a bandeau top so that you’re able to throw on a pair of shorts or skirt
    always, but always throw on a straw hat
    dainty gold jewelry looks great with your bathing suit but also when you throw on the rest of your outfit after the beach
    lastly, barely there makeup can take you from beach to lunch easily!`,

    shortDescription: "A week in paradise with Revolve!",
    description: `Kevin and I took a week to jet off to Maui and explore tropical vibes with Revolve. It had been a while since we traveled anywhere, so I was excited to show Kevin Maui, lay out, eat yummy seafood and literally do nothing but enjoy each other.

    We stayed in Wailea at the beautiful Four Seasons Maui resort and as we settled in, we were greeted by beautiful leis to welcome us! Since we got in rather late the first day, we kept it super mellow and had a light dinner and drinks! We started our first day doing a 4 hour hike where we discovered 5 beautiful waterfalls! It was followed by lunch on the beach and a chill evening to relax. We had a free day the next day so we woke up extra early to explore and drive around each beach. Had to go eat at Paia Fish Market in Lahaina because we heard from locals it was the place to eat…it was one of our favorite places for sure! We did some shopping, had dinner at Spago at our hotel FS Maui and whoa!-probably the best cocktails i’ve had were at Spagos (make sure to order the Cucumber Revenge!) We spent the whole week being together, exploring, driving off to little side roads, eating, we did so much eating.. another place I would have to recommend in Wailea is MonkeyPod-sooo good! Make sure to have their pies!
    
    We did an amazing helicopter ride, whale watching, surfing, and got to hang and talk to locals! It was one hell of a week where we felt relaxed and had so much fun! Below is a little diary of what it looked like and what I wore! Can’t wait for my next adventure very soon, make sure to follow along my social media! @sincerelyjules (instagram)`,

    title: "VEUVE CLICQUOT POLO CLASSIC 2019 – WHAT TO WEAR!",
    locationDate: "May 07",
    shortDescription:
      "After a whirlwind in Paris for fashion week, I couldn’t be happier to be back in LA and just in time for the 10th Annual Veuve Clicquot’s Polo Classic. ",
    description: `l’ve always loved the old fashioned vibe of this event. The Polo classic is known for being a really fun occasion to dress for! There is a classic and timeless feel to the attire and the sport as well. It’s all about Frilly dresses, elegant hats, bright patterns and bold statements.

    I wore my Viva Aviva puff sleeve mini dress that Im currently obsessing over. The drop waist combined with the billowy skirt and bow has a signature 80’s feel, which I’m all about! I wore my new Tom Ford white leather day bag with the T shaped metal closure for a retro monochrome contrast against the black dress. I was inspired by Old Hollywood, but I incorporated current statement pieces that have that throwback feel. I love to time travel with fashion, and this was the best event to create a fun and wearable look! Veuve’s taste was impeccable. This event and every event with Veuve is always to the nines!

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - April 12",
    shortDescription:
      "Check out my easy tips on how to throw a Spring outdoor picnic. So effortlessly cute & chic!",
    description: `A few weeks ago, I threw an intimate surprise birthday brunch for one of my best girlfriends. The weather has been so beautiful (think sunny, blue sky, over 85°degree weather!) here in LA, so I thought an outdoor Spring picnic in my backyard would be exceptionally fitting for the occasion. When it comes to putting together an event, I always make sure to have a checklist for all of the things I’ll need plus a  theme in mind so I could pull the best inspo. For this picnic, I went for a pretty Spring rustic vibe that could make you feel like you were in Italy somewhere! I wanted my girl to be surrounded by pretty blooms and pops of color for a dreamy setting and it was a big hit, everyone loved it! `,

    locationDate: "March 25",
    shortDescription:
      "I know this time has been awkwardly challenging for everyone. I think we can all relate to the wide range of feelings happening amidst the global health crisis. I wanted to try to lighten the mood with some domestic style.",
    description: `Since I’ve been able to actually hang around the house, I’ve been really appreciating our space. Tending to plants and rearranging our porch has brought me a sense of peace and has really calmed my mood. Keeping busy with domestic improvement is a great way to find your center when feeling off. Some projects I’ve been putting off forever finally got done! It feels so good to accomplish in these uncertain times.

    I have been getting so much satisfaction from home design. There is something so soothing about creating a mood with lighting and texture. The style I’m experimenting with for our home is bohemian modern with warm neutral tones and accents. I love incorporating some eclectic pieces that I’ve collected while traveling over the years. It’s a time capsule of offerings from my life. This is what creates warmth for me and the feeling of home.
    
    I love sitting outside and lounging on our porch. I’ve surrounded our little dream area with plants and cactus’s for aesthetic. Having them around me is always comforting. I like lights or lanterns for adding a soft romantic feel to a patio, and then adding pillows or throw rugs and textiles as accents. I’ve rounded up some great outdoor textiles, furniture, planters, lighting and decor that are not only super cute and versatile, but also easy on the pocket. 😉 I would love some outdoor recommendations from you all! What are your favorite indoor or outdoor home decor sites?
    
    Lets all remember to stay home and stay safe!
    
    And please let’s try to pick each other up as much as we can right now by sharing and staying connected. <3 <3`,

    title: "BEST BEAUTY PRODUCTSTO KEEP YOUR SKIN GLOWY!",
    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA April 14",
    shortDescription:
      "I'm all about having healthy skin, so come take a look at my favorite beauty products to help you achieve glowy, fresh skin! Plus new items I have my eye on!",
    description: `The balmy beautiful days of summer are soon approaching, so that means it’s time to switch up your beauty products for some that will keep your skin glowing, protected & hydrated all summer long. I’ve always been a sucker for anything beauty and I’m one of those people who will spend hours on end researching a product before using it. I’m also the type that likes to stick with what I know, and use a product over and over again but as of late I’ve had an itch to experiment with new products, especially with clean beauty. I’ve hand selected a few skincare, vitamins and tools I am currently loving (and some I have yet to try but will soon), keep scrolling to check them out! 

    ***Before you check them out, I’d love to share two tips I like to always keep in mind. First, never, I repeat NEVER leave your house without SPF! Second, always remember beauty comes within! Be kind to yourself and make sure you nourish your body as equally as you do from the outside, in. Without true self-care beauty products can only go so far. 🙂
    
    Would love to know what some of your favorite skincare products are? And if you have any that you swear by? Comment below! xx`,

    locationDate: "LOS ANGELES, CA - April 05",
    shortDescription:
      "Spring has sprung! Check out my favorite floral pieces for this season.",
    description: `Spring is here, and I couldn’t be more excited for warm weather and clear skies! This means, it’s time to ditch the loungewear, and swap my sweats for lighter items. A good selection of dresses is my personal ideal for spring.  I look forward to everything floral and light, as well as the easiness of these months leading up to summer. Spring is always a much needed change of vibe, and I welcome the mood every year. It’s a breath of fresh air as far as trends are concerned. By this time we are all ready to move out of the winter wardrobe, and show some skin!

    What dresses and patterns are you crushing on? Let me know ???????? Happy solstice!

      "Check out sneakers that Im loving and living in this season!",
    description: `Spring is here, and I couldn’t be more excited for warm weather and clear skies! This means, it’s time to ditch the loungewear, and swap my sweats for lighter items. A good selection of dresses is my personal ideal for spring.  I look forward to everything floral and light, as well as the easiness of these months leading up to summer. Spring is always a much needed change of vibe, and I welcome the mood every year. It’s a breath of fresh air as far as trends are concerned. By this time we are all ready to move out of the winter wardrobe, and show some skin!

    What dresses and patterns are you crushing on? Let me know ???????? Happy solstice!
    
    Keep scrolling to shop my favorite floral pieces this season.`,
